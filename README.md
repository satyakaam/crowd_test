Build and deploy a web application that fetches random phrases from the database via AJAX.

Example: https://crowdbotics-rails-test.herokuapp.com/

- Generate 10 phrases.
- Phrases must be fetched and displayed via Ajax.
- Phrases must not repeat on one page.
- When user reloads page all displayed phrases must save their state (including sequence they’re displayed).
- Displayed phrases must not share the state between different clients. (i.e. if I enter the site from another browser or incognito mode, I shouldn’t see phrases I fetched from main browser). (Optional but highly valued)
- Deploy the application.
